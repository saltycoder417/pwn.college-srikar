# 1. Learning from documentation: 

### In this challenge, a program was given to run with a specific argument to get the flag. The program was '/challenge/challenge' and the argument we have to use is '--giveflag'. The argument was given in the documentation of the program.

**Flag:** `pwn.college{MakBG45ZOH73DdJ0CNvpohX8Gvg.QX0ITO0wiN3kjNzEzW}`

I invoked the given program along with the argument they gave in the terminal to get the flag.

```
hacker@man~learning-from-documentation:~$ /challenge/challenge --giveflag
Correct argument! Here is your flag:
pwn.college{MakBG45ZOH73DdJ0CNvpohX8Gvg.QX0ITO0wiN3kjNzEzW}
```

## What I learned

I learned how the correct usage of programs depends, in a large part, on the proper specification of arguments to them. I also learned one of the need of a documentation of a program is to figure out which 
argument to use on the command line. One of the main needs of a documentation is to figure out how to use programs correctly.

**Flag:** `pwn.college{helloworld}`

explain your solve and how you got to it, explain any incorrect tangents you went on while solving.

to put code snippets, put three backticks and for images and all other stuff you wish to put here, refer to the documentation given to you.

don't style it too much, your solve should be readable and understandable by you so that when you have doubts, you refer to your own writeups, instead of gpt.

```
#!/bin/bash
