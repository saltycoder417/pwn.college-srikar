# 1. Matching with *: 

### In this challenge, it was given to change your directory to '/challenge', but use globbing to keep the argument you pass to cd to at most four characters. After that it told to run '/challenge/run' to get the flag.

**Flag:** `pwn.college{YldJl_3dPGSdHeXtjc9cDhz7qRa.QXxIDO0wiN3kjNzEzW}`

I changed my cwd to '/challenge' and kept it within 4 characters by using '*' glob. After the cwd changed, i ran the program to get the flag. 

```
hacker@globbing~matching-with-:~$ cd /ch*
hacker@globbing~matching-with-:/challenge$ /challenge/run
You ran me with the working directory of /challenge! Here is your flag:
pwn.college{YldJl_3dPGSdHeXtjc9cDhz7qRa.QXxIDO0wiN3kjNzEzW}
```

## What I learned

I first learned about globbing. Globbing lets you reference files without typing out their full paths. Before executing commands that you enter, the shell first performs expansions on them, and one of these 
expansions is globbing. In this challenge, i learned about the "*" glob, When it encounters a "*" character in any argument, the shell will treat it as a wildcard and try to replace that argument with any files 
that match the pattern. It can match multiple files or single files also if only 1 file is there with that pattern. When zero files are matched,the shell leaves the glob unchanged. The "*" matches any part of the 
filename except for "/" or a leading ".".

explain your solve and how you got to it, explain any incorrect tangents you went on while solving.

to put code snippets, put three backticks and for images and all other stuff you wish to put here, refer to the documentation given to you.

don't style it too much, your solve should be readable and understandable by you so that when you have doubts, you refer to your own writeups, instead of gpt.
