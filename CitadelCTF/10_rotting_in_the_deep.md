# description:
The floor is quiet, almost unnervingly so â€“ like the Citadel has paused to take your measure. A soft ring of presence settles around the chamber, the kind that marks a true landing: from here, it will ask for more and, in return, grant more. Etched into its surface is a sequence of numbers, worn and faint, as if time itself is eating them away. A whisper from the echoes guides you:

The message lies beneath the surface. Push it three steps forward in the cycle of life, and only then will the words emerge from the void.
# writeup: 
flag:```citadel{br0_r34lly_unr0tt3d_m3_b4ck_t0_l1f3}```

There was a python source file and a random number given. As they gave in the description, we have to first shift the digits forward by 3, and then convert it to text from integer to get the flag. Python code is 
```
from Crypto.Util.number import *
ct = '6895840967002953721051398351211751734500850509315790892845302801984496338433523326225010635779036738800318'
flag = ''
for digit in ct:
    flag += str((int(digit)-3)%10)

print(long_to_bytes(int(flag)))
```
