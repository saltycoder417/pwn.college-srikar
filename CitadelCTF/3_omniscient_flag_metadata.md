# description:
As you step into the second chamber, a figure manifests before you. Before you stands a forgotten deity, a dead god spoken of only in whispers. Known by countless names: “Apostle of Epilogue and Eternity,” “Lone Messiah” and many more lost to time.

They leave nothing but a single image, a relic carrying his final secret. Hidden within its layers lies the key to ascend to the next chamber.

They first gave us a photo. I kept that photo in a hex editor, and in that meta data it was written author had a habit of hiding images in images. So there is an image inside that image. I kept that image in cyberchef website and then extracted all the text and embedded images in the image they gave. 1 image was extracted which had the flag.
