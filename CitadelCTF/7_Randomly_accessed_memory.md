# Description: 

On your ascent to this floor, you hear these fragments being played back —
```
clone it, pull it, reset it, stage it, 
commit, push it, fork, rebase it. 
merge it, branch it, tag it, log it, 
add it, stash it, diff, untrack it …
```
You look around and discover a chamber containing a vast archive of Daft Punk’s music, intertwined with cryptic commits left behind by other musicians. They seem ordinary at first glance, but not everything in the history is what it seems. The archive: https://github.com/evilcryptonite/daft-punk-archive
# writeup: 
flag:```citadel{w3_4r3_up_4ll_n1t3_t0_g1t_lucky}```

In the hint, things related to github like clone it, pull it, branch it, etc, were given. There were 3 different parts of the flag, each placed at a different commit. We also had to decode each of the pieces found and then attach them to get the complete flag.
