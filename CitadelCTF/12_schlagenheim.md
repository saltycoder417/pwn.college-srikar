# description: 
Your quest continues, but you feel something odd about this room. The only artifact on this floor is a corrupted file held in the hands of a jet-black statue, frozen in the pose of a band mid-performance. The passcode to the next floor is hidden within this piece of music, but it canâ€™t be played, as if the wrong extension has scrambled it.

You must take the corrupted file and repair it to reveal the true code that will unlock the door forward.

In this challenge, a corrupted wav file was given. When we keep this file in a hex editor, some of the bytes say M1D1, which hints it might be a MIDI file. The bytes in the header that say M1D1 have to be changed to MThd as that is the file header for a MIDI file. After doing all these changes and then opening it in a software which can visualise MIDI files, we can see the flag.
