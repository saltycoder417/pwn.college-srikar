# description: 
The symphonic adventure does not end here. On the next floor, a single song keeps echoing through the floor, repeating in a haunting loop. Amid the sound, you find a note left by a past candidate. It hints that the song holds a secret message, hidden in plain sight, much like how Aphex Twin concealed his face within his music with the help of spectrograms.

To move forward, you must find the message hidden in this sound.

Note: Separate the words in the flag with _ and make it UPPERCASE. Example: citadel{S3L3CT3D_AMB13NT_W0RK}
# writeup: 
flag:```citadel{1_L0V3_1DM}```

There was a audio file given. In the audio file morse code started playing. Online morse code decoders couldn't decode it maybe because it was distorted. So we kept it on a online  spectrogram, and one part of the code, at around 1:00 to 1:12 had the flag, and it showed the morse code. We decoded the morse code and got the flag.
