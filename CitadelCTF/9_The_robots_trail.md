# description: 
You enter a virtual maze, a labyrinth of shifting corridors and endless paths. A guardian robot patrols the floor, leaving a trail behind as it moves. Follow the path it carves, trace its movements carefully, and uncover the key it leads you to. Only by following the robotâ€™s trail can you reach the door to the next floor.

There was a website given in the description of the challenge. In the website, after clicking inspect, there was a website robots.txt whose display was blocked on the website. After going to robots.txt this was there

```
Since it told /etc/passwd can reveal interesting information, we went there. From here we went into different files based on the clues given and at last went to /home/ctf/.secret/flag.txt, which had the flag.
