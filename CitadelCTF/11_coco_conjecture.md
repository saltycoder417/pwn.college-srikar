To enter the next chamber, you must complete the task presented by her. Complete it exactly as instructed, achieving operational efficiency by her standards, and the path forward will open.

There was a pdf given, which explained a type of maths problem called collate conjecture. There was also a python source file given on how to connect it with pwntools or socket to communicate with the instance. We have to make a function that calculates the number of steps required to get the number to baseform. The number is provided by the server. If we do all this correctly, we will get the flag.
